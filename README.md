## Welcome to Agro-Wallflower's first Github page!

### I hope to learn quite a bit about Github from this little exercise!

I am very new to coding but I am enjoying learning about it, an I hope to greatly expand my knowledge.

- Languages I would like to know more about:

1. JSS
2. C++

**HTML and CSS are the languages I am most comfortable in** but _I hope to learn other languages in the future_ and `Code` text

[Here is a link to my college's website]https://www.arapahoe.edu/)
```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Agro-Wallflower/Agro-Wallflower.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
